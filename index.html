  <p> Chelsea FC was founded in 1905 by Henry Augustus Mears. Home games are played at Stamford Bridge stadium, the original site Mears chose for the club. The team had mixed fortunes over the years, not winning a major trophy until the 1950s and moving up and down between divisions several times. The Blues improved their standing in the 1990s and the early 21st century to become one of the most successful clubs in English football.
